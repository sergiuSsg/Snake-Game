Snake Game made in Plain JS

It was made with a different concept on a exact 10 x 10 grid(not necessarly a scalable version), using modulus to find the edges of the grid.
The game stops when the snake collides with one of the four walls or itself and has the score above the grid.

I made use of the following:
-event listeners
-query selectors
-arrow functions
-time intervals and countdowns
